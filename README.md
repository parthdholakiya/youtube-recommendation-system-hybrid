![YouTube Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/YouTube_Logo_2017.svg/1200px-YouTube_Logo_2017.svg.png)

## Overview

This project is a hybrid YouTube recommender system designed to suggest videos similar to the one chosen by the user. It combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized video recommendations. The content-based aspect relies on video tags and uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, while the collaborative filtering component takes into account user preferences, specifically their likes, and utilizes algorithms like KNNBaseline.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
    ```

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/parthdholakiya/youtube-recommendation-system-hybrid.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd YouTube-Recommendation-System
    ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run Hybrid_YouTube Recom_app.py
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to interact with the recommendation system.

## Usage

1. Choose a video from the dropdown list.
2. Click the 'Show Recommendation' button to get personalized video recommendations.
3. Explore and discover new videos that match your interests.
