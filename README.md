# hybrid youtube-recommendation-system
The hybrid recommendation system is a special type of system that used data of both collaborative data and content-based data simultaneously which helps to suggest a similar or close item to the users. Combining the two above approaches helps to resolve the big problems in more effective cases sometimes.

The two main types of recommendation algorithms used in hybrid systems are:

(1) Content-based filtering: This algorithm recommends items based on the similarity of their content to items the user has previously liked or interacted with. For example, if a user has liked movies with action and adventure, the content-based algorithm will recommend similar action and adventure movies.

(2) Collaborative filtering: This algorithm recommends items based on the similarity of the user's preferences with those of other users. For example, if a user has liked movies that other users with similar tastes have also liked, the collaborative filtering algorithm will recommend similar movies to the user.
